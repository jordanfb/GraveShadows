Overheard some guards talking in the factory’s loading bay:


“You know what I never understood? Why they’ve only got one person bringing in shipments. Wouldn’t it be better to give us more to work with?”


“Maybe. But then they’d have to worry about any one of the drivers running their mouths.”


“I guess that’s true. Easier to keep one person quiet than a fleet of truck drivers.”


“Well I don’t think they’ve got anything to worry about. From what I understand the driver’s way more than just a lackey.”


“I do trust myself more than anyone else. Maybe that’s their philosophy.”


“Sounds about right to me.”


They’ve got a point. Their driver is quick, efficient, and quiet.
