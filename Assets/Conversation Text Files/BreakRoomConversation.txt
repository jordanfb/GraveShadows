#Guard1
Did you happen to see what they were drafting up in the conference room this morning?
#


#Guard2
I didn’t. What sort of crazy shit are they up to this time?
#


#Guard1
Not sure, but they had maps laid out everywhere. 
#


#Guard2
Must’ve been planning new routes to the factory. Gotta shake things up from time to time.
#


#Guard1
Whoever’s got to drive that’s got their hands full. 
#


#Guard2
From what I’ve heard, whoever’s doing it is a professional. Gets to and from the place in record time.
