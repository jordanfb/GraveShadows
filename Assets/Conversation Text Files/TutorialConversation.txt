#Cop1
Shame he had to go. If he’d just let go of Graves’ pipe dream this wouldn’t have happened. 
#


#Cop2
Real shame. Still, I’d rather go out in a hit than the way Graves did.
#


#Cop1
Yeah. He got a real close look at that nuclear explosion. Guess he wanted to see what they were up to, but got a lot more than he bargained for. 
#


#Cop2
Cooked him <i>real</i> good. Ya know, I’ve always wondered what they do out there.
#


#Cop1
I’ve heard rumors. Some sorta weapon development. They’re still pumping them out. 
#


#Cop2
Shouldn’t they have shut down after that explosion?
#


#Cop1
Nah. The Family’s got it in real good with the captain. He’s made sure the way is clear for them.
