#Guard1
Passed another inspection.
#


#Guard2
Heh, well that’s easy when the inspector is on your side.
#


#Guard1
You don’t say? Hey, how about that woman that was with him? You ever seen her before?
#


#Guard2
She’s been with him a few times before. A secretary or something.
#


#Guard1
Really? Damn, I’m sure she’s pretty clued into the Family’s plans if they trust her enough to see everything we’re doing.
#


#Guard2
You want my opinion? She’s dangerous. I think she’s a lot more involved than she lets on. I’d steer clear.
