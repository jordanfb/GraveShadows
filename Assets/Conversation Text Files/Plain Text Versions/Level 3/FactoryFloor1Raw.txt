Overheard some guards talking in the factory:


“Pretty big shipment today.”


“Damn, how hard do you think he has them working out there?”


“Eh, it’s best not to question it.  That’s not our department.”


“Still, I can’t help but wonder how they stay sane underground all day.”


“Heh...they probably don’t.”


Sounds like their mine is still operational, regardless of the conditions. Feel bad for the poor bastards they have working for them out there.
