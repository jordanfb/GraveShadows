Caught a conversation between some guards in the office break room:


“Did you happen to see what they were drafting up in the conference room this morning?”


“I didn’t. What sort of crazy shit are they up to this time?”


“Not sure, but they had maps laid out everywhere.”


“Must’ve been planning new routes to the factory. Gotta shake things up from time to time.”


“Whoever’s got to drive that’s got their hands full.”


“From what I’ve heard, whoever’s doing it is a professional. Gets to and from the place in record time.”


Speed demon, huh? The driver likes to get things done fast.
