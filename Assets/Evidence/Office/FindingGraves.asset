    thought we were finished. I thought once we took out Graves and his partner we\u2019d
    be through with noncompliant pests digging too far into our affairs. But it looks
    like someone\u2019s still on our trail. Some key evidence went missing from Marvin\u2019s
    office before our cop friends were able to clean it all up for us. \r\n\r\nNow
    I\u2019m not one to believe in ghosts, but that and the fact that some personal
    items have gone missing from Graves\u2019 office make me think that somehow our
    detective friend crawled out of that explosion like a roach.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re
    so close now. There\u2019s only a week until our big meeting, and I\u2019ll be
    damned if I let that brooding old hack stand in our way now. Graves isn\u2019t
    walking out of our next meeting alive. Not again. Anybody who knows anything about
    Graves\u2019 location better relay that to me immediately. \r\n\r\nWe wouldn\u2019t
    want any of you suffering the same fate now would we?\r\n\r\n-X\r\n\n---------END
