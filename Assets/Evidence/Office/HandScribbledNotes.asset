    TEXT---------\nStevenson moves his mouth when he reads. Sure sign of stupidity.
    He\u2019ll never be more than a paper-pusher.\r\n\r\nDarrin asked for a raise.
    Something about a pregnant wife. Seems like he doesn\u2019t care enough about
    the right Family. \r\n\r\nBrackenridge is wearing hats more often than usual.
    Claims its the style. I saw him staring at wigs in a shop window.\r\n\r\nTurner\u2019s
    trying to quit smokes. Says they killed his uncle. Bullshit.  \r\n\r\nCarter\u2019s
    coat is lumpy on one side. Gun? Drugs?\r\n    --Update: a flask!\r\n\n---------END
