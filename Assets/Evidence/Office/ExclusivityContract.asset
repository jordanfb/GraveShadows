    Brackenridge (hereby referred to as \u201CBuyer\u201D). \r\n\r\nSeller and Buyer
    have expressed interest in entering into an exclusivity agreement in regards to

    the due date, Seller reserves the right to apply a 10% late fee to the invoice
    total. \r\n\r\nFailure to pay constitutes a breach of contract. Seller reserves
    the right to terminate the exclusivity agreement. If termination occurs, Buyer
    is still responsible for all funds due. Seller also has the right to pursue legal
    action to recoup due fees. \r\n\r\nBoth parties agree to an obligation to uphold

    action over the course of the Agreement.\r\n\r\n5. Taxes\r\n\r\nBuyer is responsible
    for paying any and all state, local, and/or federal taxes due for goods listen
