  _flavorText: "\"It's a shame what's happening to their people. Doesn't excuse crime
    though.\"\n\n---------FULL TEXT---------\n    The Indian Navajo people of the
    American Southwest continue to struggle to survive in today\u2019s quickly modernizing
    world.\r\n\n    The territory claimed by the Navajo nation has already been found
    to hold several uranium deposits - the radioactive element crucial in creating
    weapons that could turn the tide against the Reds. Despite the importance of such
    a material, the natives have proved hesitant to share their land, citing illness
    caused by improper environmental considerations when mining. \r\n\n    This contention
    comes on the heels of the Navajo Livestock reduction, the sacrifice of a portion
    of Navajo livestock in order to prevent a second Dust Bowl disaster. The Indians
    have argued that their livestock are both sacred and their main source of income
    (perhaps a contradictory statement), and that the Reduction has destroyed three-quarters
    of their livestock population and decimated their way of life. \r\n\n    We good
    American people can only hope that the Indians realize the error of their ways
    and join us in the fight against the Communist party.\r\n\n---------END TEXT---------"
