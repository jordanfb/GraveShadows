  _bio: "Gender: Male\r\n\r\nAge: 56\r\n\r\nBackground: Born into moderate wealth.
    He took over the family\u2019s textile business after the death of his father
    and grew it to far larger proportions, making him a very wealthy man. Being a
    speculative man, in the mid-1920s he liquidated his position for a tidy sum. After
    the market crash and the depression hit, he began buying smaller businesses and
    movie studios which helped him to balloon his wealth even further. While not embedded
    in the government himself, being a man who\u2019s always prided himself on making
    more money, he\u2019s been known for funneling funds into multiple projects that
    he feels can make him money, and even starting a few things himself.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career:
    Currently, he\u2019s an investor and executive for multiple movie studios. He\u2019s
    also bought back a controlling share of his family\u2019s textile business.\r\n\r\nMotivations:
    Money. Everything comes down to money, regardless of what he has to do to get
    it.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: A bit of a recluse. While the
    public knows his name, and his businesses, they rarely see his face. Whenever
    he does make a public appearance, it\u2019s with a convincing smile and an unmistakable
    look."
