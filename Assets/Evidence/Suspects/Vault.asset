  _bio: "Gender: Female\r\n \r\nAge: 33 \r\n\r\nBackground: She was never more than
    just another pretty face in the crowd. She grew up the same way as everybody else.
    She went to school, struggled through the depression with her already pauper parents,
    and eventually found herself moving from her small midwestern homestead to the
    big city in hopes of making something of her life. But the big move only seemed
    to bring with it stress and a smoking habit. Eventually, she landed a gig as a
    simple secretary for a high profile client. While it was menial at first, eventually
    it became her job to keep track of all the boss\u2019 dealings, legal or otherwise.
    She became a master at keeping and\\compiling information, and with this, was
    always one step ahead of trouble. That little taste of power has since left her
    wanting more, and she had a knack at digging up any incriminating information
    on anyone who stood in her way.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career: Secretary for Thomas Carter\r\n\r\nMotivations:
    She\u2019s entirely motivated by her dream to make it big, and if that means she
    has to bring down the people on the top through blackmail, so be it. Wants her
    name to be known.\r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: Smoker, but other
    than that she blends into any crowd with ease. The people only see her as a simple
    secretary (if they even know who she is), not realizing how dangerous she can
    be."
