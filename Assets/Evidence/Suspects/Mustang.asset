  _codeName: Mustang
  _bio: "Gender: Female\r\n\r\nAge: mid-20s\r\n\r\nBackground: The Mustang grew up
    on a ranch in Missouri, where she developed a love for all things fast. She raced
    anything she could on horseback - local boys, rivers, wild animals, anything.
    As she grew older, even the fastest racehorses couldn\u2019t scratch the itch,
    so she turned her love to fast cars, learning to fix up the most broken vehicles
    to save money. When a fire destroyed her family\u2019s ranch, she decided to head
    east to the big city, searching for a job working with cars. She found one with
    the Family, who needed a getaway driver that wasn\u2019t afraid to get dirty and
    do some repairs. She applied her reckless abandon and talents from making repairs
    on the ranch to find a niche in the Family, and sends money home to her parents
    out west so they can repair and build up the ranch.\r\n\r\nPosition/Career: Mechanic,
    getaway driver\r\n\r\nMotivations: On the surface, she just needs money for the
    newest, fastest cars. But she also needs money to send home to her family ranch.
    \r\n\r\nQuirks/Personality/Public Perception: She\u2019s a bit louder than people
    generally like dealing with, but she\u2019s trustworthy."
