    incident with Graves out at your testing site has been taken care of. We\u2019ve
    addressed his death as the death of a hero caught in the line of duty, but have
    scrubbed all findings of your work from the case files, leaving the public and
    the government none the wiser. The positive press for my officers has helped to
    keep any suspicion off of our backs.\r\n\r\nThere is still one problem. Graves\u2019
    old partner, Detective Marvin Mitchell, has picked up some of the threads of the
    work that Graves left behind. I\u2019ve talked to him about dropping the case,
    and he agreed to do so professionally, but I suspect he may still be looking into
    your affairs on his own time.\r\n\r\nHe lives at 201 Corner Street, Apartment
    303. It\u2019d be a real shame to lose him if the grief of losing his partner
    became too much, and he did something stupid.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChief Clapton\r\n---------END
